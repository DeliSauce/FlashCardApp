During compile phase, just microseconds before your code is executed, it is scanned for function and variable declarations.

So that they can be used even before they are actually declared in the source code.\n\nVariables declared with var are hoisted WITH a default initialization (no error if accessing before declaration - returns \"undefined\")\nVariables declared with let or const are hoisted WITHOUT a default initialization. (will throw error if you try accessing variable before declaration)\nOnly function declarations are hoisted in JavaScript, function expressions (assigning a function to a variable) are not hoisted. Thus you can use a declared function before it is actually declared.\n\nJust as let and const declarations, classes in JavaScript are also hoisted, and just as let or const declarations, they remain uninitialized until evaluation. Thus you must declare them first before using\n\n**To avoid possible side effects of hoisting like undefined variables or reference error, always try to declare the variables at the top of their respective scopes and also always try to initialize variables when you declare them.\n\nhttps://blog.bitsrc.io/hoisting-in-modern-javascript-let-const-and-var-b290405adfda","","JS","Q → A"],["Currying"],["falsey values","There are only six falsey values in JavaScript: undefined, null, NaN, 0, \"\" (empty string), and false of course.","","JS","Q → A"],["== vs ===","","","JS","Q → A"],["event loop","","","Web"],["event bubbling","","","Web"],["function declaration vs function expression vs arrow function","Function declarations are added to the memory during the compile stage, so we are able to access it in our code before the actual function declaration.\nhelloWorld();  // prints 'Hello World!' to the console\nfunction helloWorld(){\n  console.log('Hello World!');\n}\n\nFunction expressions\nhelloWorld();  // TypeError: helloWorld is not a function\nvar helloWorld = function(){\n  console.log('Hello World!');\n}\n\nArrow Function\ndo not have their own this\nimplicit return when written on one line\nlet func = (arg) => {return arg + 1}","","JS","Q → A"],["WebAssembly (WASM)","","","Web"],["relational database vs non-relational database","","","Backend"],["ES6","Second major revision.
