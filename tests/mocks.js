Estimating the number of fish in the sea is incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to do precisely. Here's why, and what we do know:\n\n**Why it's so hard to count:**\n\n*   **Vastness of the ocean:** The ocean covers over 70% of the Earth's surface and is extremely deep in places. We can't observe or sample most of it easily.\n*   **Variety of species:** There are thousands of species of fish, ranging from tiny plankton-eating fish to massive sharks. Each species has different behaviors, habitats, and population dynamics.\n*   **Constant movement:** Fish are constantly moving, migrating, and reproducing. This makes it hard to get a static \"snapshot\" of their populations.`

export const geminiTest = `The meaning of life is a deeply personal and philosophical question with no single, universally accepted answer. Different perspectives offer varying interpretations:\n\n*   **Philosophical perspectives:** Some philosophies, like nihilism, argue that life is inherently meaningless. Others, like existentialism, suggest that we create our own meaning through our choices and actions. Absurdism acknowledges the inherent conflict between our desire for meaning and the meaninglessness of the universe, urging us to embrace the absurdity.\n\n*   **Religious perspectives:** Many religions offer a pre-defined meaning to life, often centered around serving a higher power, following specific moral codes, and striving for spiritual enlightenment or eternal salvation.\n\n*   **Humanistic perspectives:** Humanism emphasizes the importance of human agency, reason, ethics, and social justice. The meaning of life, from this perspective, might involve contributing to the well-being of others, pursuing knowledge, and experiencing joy and fulfillment.\n\n*   **Personal perspectives:** Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it. It can be found in relationships, creativity, learning, experiencing the world, making a difference, or simply enjoying the present moment. It's a journey of self-discovery and defining your own values and purpose. It's not about finding a pre-packaged answer but rather about creating your own meaning.\n\nRather than searching for a universal answer, it's often more fruitful to explore your own values, passions, and what gives your life purpose and direction. Consider what impact you want to have on the world and how you want to spend your time. This process of self-reflection and action will lead you to discover your own unique meaning.`
