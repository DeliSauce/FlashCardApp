### To deploy to localhost:

##### other useful CLI commands
- npx expo-doctor


### To do list
- need to figure out how to hide Google credentials from users and how to deploy them (look into Expo EAS, expo-secure-store)
- swipe tracking: track left vs right swipes, record data (should probably be maintained at the 'user' level instead of the 'card'/'collection' level if we want collection sharing in the future), and dynamically set card display order based on optimal frequency (i.e. show known info less often)
- figure out best RN component for buttons (pressable, touchableopacity, button, etc)
- make sure that UI is reachable at bottom of screen
- 


- install firebase
    "@google-cloud/local-auth": "^2.1.0",
    "firebase": "^10.12.5",
    "googleapis": "^105.0.0",

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
